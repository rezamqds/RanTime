# RanTime
This script is able to generate random number based on time. Also (PRNG).
it is completely clear the generated numbers are Pseudorandom. 
Although this code is designed in terms of CPU and time based on milliseconds, it obviously should not be cryptographically secure, which has not been tested or edited.
